# Samples

RoboVM comes with an extensive set of samples, available on [Github](https://github.com/robovm/robovm-samples). The samples are composed of ports of Apple's sample apps as well as apps we created ourselves. Most notable is ContractR, a simple task tracker app. The sample shows you how to create a cross-platform iOS & Android app, either using the native UIs of JavaFX, while sharing all its business logic across all platforms.

The samples can be built and run from Eclipse, Maven, or Gradle. Refer to the repository's `README.md` for up-to-date instructions!
