# Samples

RoboVM comes with an extensive set of samples, available on [Github](https://github.com/robovm/robovm-samples). The samples are composed of ports of Apple's sample apps as well as apps we created ourselves. 

In this article, we'll walk you through getting the samples, compiling and running them with Eclipse, IDEA, Maven and Gradle.

## Getting the Samples
To download the samples, you'll need to clone them via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robovm/robovm-samples
```

After you successfully cloned the samples, move on to the section for your prefered development environment:

* Eclipse
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Maven
* Gradle

## Eclipse
You can import the samples into Eclipse either via m2e/Maven or Gradle.

### Import via Maven
1. Go to *File -> Import...*.
2. Select *Maven -> Existing Maven Projects*.
3. Set *Root Directory* to the directory you cloned the samples into (`robovm-samples/`).
4. Click *Finish*.

You can now proceed to compile, run and debug the samples, as outlined in the [Getting Started Guide for Eclipse](getting-started/eclipse.md).

### Import via Gradle
Before you can import the samples via Gradle, you need to install the [Gradle Integration for Eclipse](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gradle-integration-eclipse-44). You can install it the the Eclipse Market Place (*Help -> Eclipse Market Place...*).

After installing the plugin, you can proceed as follows:
1. Go to *File -> Import...*.
2. Select *Gradle -> Gradle Project*.
3. Set *Root folder* to the directory you cloned the samples into (`robovm-samples/`).
4. Click *Build Model*.
5. Check the checkbox next to the `robovm-samples` entry. All other projects should be selected as well.
5. Click *Finish*.

You can now proceed to compile, run and debug the samples, as outlined in the [Getting Started Guide for Eclipse](getting-started/eclipse.md).

## IntelliJ IDEA
You can import the samples into IntelliJ IDEA either via Maven or Gradle.

### Import via Maven
1. Go to *File -> Open*.
2. Select the `pom.xml` file in the root directory fo the samples.
3. Click OK.

You can now proceed to compile, run and debug the samples, as outlined in the [Getting Started Guide for IntelliJ IDEA](getting-started/intellij.md).

### Import via Gradle
1. Go to *File -> Open*.
2. Select the `settings.gradle` file in the root directory fo the samples.
3. In the Gradle dialogue, keep all settinsg as they are and click *OK*.

You can now proceed to compile, run and debug the samples, as outlined in the [Getting Started Guide for IntelliJ IDEA](getting-started/intellij.md).

## Maven
In the root directory, do:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will compile all samples. Next, switch into a sample directory and execute one of the following:

```bash
# to launch on an IPhone simulator
mvn robovm:iphone-sim

# to launch on an IPad simulator
mvn robovm:iphone-sim

# to launch on a connected device
mvn robovm:ios-device
```

See the [RoboVM Maven Plugin documentation](getting-started/maven.md) for more information.

## Gradle
In the root directory, do:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

This will compile all samples. Next, switch into a sample directory and execute one of the following:

```bash
# to launch on an IPhone simulator
./gradlew launchIPhoneSimulator

# to launch on an IPad simulator
./gradlew launchIPadSimulator

# to launch on a connected device
./gradlew launchIOSDevice
```

See the [RoboVM Gradle Plugin documentation](getting-started/gradle.md) for more information.
