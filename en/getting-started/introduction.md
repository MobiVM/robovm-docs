# Getting Started

In this section you'll learn how to install RoboVM and make sure the toolchain works correctly by creating a very simple demo app.

> TIP: Want run RoboVM on Linux? You can build Linux console apps using RoboVM at this time. Please see the [RoboVM GitHub wiki](https://github.com/robovm/robovm/wiki/Get-started-on-Linux) for instructions.

## Prerequisites

In order to use RoboVM the following is required:

* A Mac running Mac OS X {{ book.osxVersion }} or later
* [Oracle's Java SE JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or later
* [Xcode {{ book.xcodeVersion }} from the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

> NOTE: The first time you install Xcode and every time you update to a new version you have to open it once to agree to the Xcode terms.

> NOTE: To be able to test and deploy your apps on your devices, you will need an active subscription with the Apple Developer Program. Visit the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/register/index.action) to sign up. You will also need to provision your device for development. You can find information on device provisioning in the Apple Developer Portal, or follow [this guide](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-teach/how-to-prepare/ios-device-provisioning/).
